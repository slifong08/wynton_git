    Assigning endogenous tiles to one enhancer region. Multiple tiles were designed for each enhancer, I'm guessing, because the EMF-sensitive enhancer sequence was longer than the 270bp oligo synthesis limit. To assign enhancers to training, validation, and test sets, I intersected k27ac_diff.bed and ATAC_diff.bed with the tiled coordinates. In total, there are 43047 enhancers with ATAC, H3K27ac annotations that correspond to N=10639 enhancer sequences. Of these, there are 204 shuffled enhancer sequences and two positive controls. There are 32850 endogenous sequences with enhancer names (N = 9826 enhancers total), MPRA activity, and sei predictions. I presume the other endogenous sequences did not get tested for activity (N = 67994 elements were tested for activity of N=82472 elements in the design fasta). 
    
**Linear regression** We used linear regression to model the change in mean MPRA activity between US +/- in endogenous sequences using 60 sequence class predictions from SEI. The hypothesis is that embedded sequence class features may predict changes in MPRA activity due to US. The mean MPRA activity score was computed from log2 transformed and standard-scaled replicates to adjust for variance within a replicate. Scores were not standardized across replicates before computing the mean. We split 32850 endogenous enhancer sequence tiles into a 80:20 train test sets grouped by chromosome. Using a standard scalar and the linear regression function in sklearn, we fit a linear regression model to the training data and tested performance on held-out chromosomes. On the test set, the performance was horrible (pearson R2 = 0.01, RMSE = 0.22). This may not be surprising, as the features reflect how promoter- or enhancer-like a sequence is and how well those sequences cluster with other enhancers and promoters. It is not meant to detect sequence-based differences attributable to US exposure. Promisingly, the coefficients with the largest weights are from the transcript/TN classes TN1, TN2, 

** calling significance between US and CTRL **

T-test: For each tile, I performed a t-test on log2 transformed MPRA activity values between 3 control and 3 ultrasound exposed replicates, not assuming equal variance. The issue with this test is that we violate the assumption that observations for an enhancer is independent. That is, we perform multiple significance tests for similar sequences that have off-set of 65/66bp (ATAC) to 133/134 (H3K27ac) bases. We assume that the observations are independent from one another, but their activity measures may be  related to one another because activity may be driven from an overlapping sequence region. The multiple T-tests drives up our family-wise error rate, producing nominally significant p-values that are actually false positives. 

Repeated measures T-test: One way to address this problem of independence is to evaluate the enhancer-wise activity differences and treat each tile as a repeated measure of one enhancer in the US/Control conditions. This relieves us of the independent observation condition, though the measures between tiles of enhancer sequences are not exact repeated measures. We also perform fewer significance tests, which reduces the correction burden. The paired t-test approach may be problematic because the same MPRA sequence is not exactly observed twice, but its activity is repeatedly measured with and without ultrasound exposure. These measures were only done for the ATAC and H3K27AC elements, as their tiles were designed over the same enhancer.  

FDR and Bonferroni corrections: T-test and repeated-measures T-test were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg and Bonferroni correction methods with an alpha of 0.1. T-test p-values were corrected over all tiles, while repeated-measures p-values were corrected over all enhancers. 

Bootstrapping the 95% confidence intervals of the delta-distribution - I estimated the top 97.5% and bottom 2.5% of delta median —i.e. difference between the median log2 control and median log2 ultrasound score—by bootstrapping the delta distribution 10,000 times. This gave me the confidences intervals for the 97.5% and 2.5% estimate of the delta distribution. I then considered any delta median value greater than the upper estimate of the top 97.5% or less than the lower 2.5% estimate as nominally significant with respect to the empirical distribution.  

KS-test of delta distribution - Would not work here. Tests whether distribution is normal or not. 

** Activity **
Activity - called based on whether the mean MPRA score is > greater than the top 97.5% of shuffled seqeunces or less than the bottom 2.5% of shuffled sequences. Activity was called separately for the control and ultrasound sets separately.
